        <h2>Bangladesh Flag </h2>
        <img src="Flag.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The national flag of Bangladesh  was adopted officially on 17 January 1972. It consists of a red disc on top  of a green field. The red disc is offset slightly toward the hoist so that it appears centred when the flag is flying. The disc represents the sun rising over Bengal, and also the blood of those who died for the independence of Bangladesh. The green field stands for the lushness of the land of Bangladesh and the eternal youth of Bangladeshis.</p>
        <p>The flag is based on a similar flag used during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, which had a yellow map of the country inside the red disc. In 1972 this map was removed from the flag. One reason given was the difficulty for rendering the map correctly on both sides of the flag. The civil ensign and naval ensign place it in the canton of a red or white field, respectively.</p>
