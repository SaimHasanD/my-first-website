        <h2>Bangladesh Flag </h2>
        <img src="Flag.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The national flag of Bangladesh  was adopted officially on 17 January 1972. It consists of a red disc on top  of a green field. The red disc is offset slightly toward the hoist so that it appears centred when the flag is flying. The disc represents the sun rising over Bengal, and also the blood of those who died for the independence of Bangladesh. The green field stands for the lushness of the land of Bangladesh and the eternal youth of Bangladeshis.</p>
        <p>The flag is based on a similar flag used during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, which had a yellow map of the country inside the red disc. In 1972 this map was removed from the flag. One reason given was the difficulty for rendering the map correctly on both sides of the flag. The civil ensign and naval ensign place it in the canton of a red or white field, respectively.</p>

        <h2>Human eye</h2>
        <img src="Human eye.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Humans have two eyes, situated on the left and the right of the face. The eyes sit in bony cavities called the orbits, in the skull. There are six extraocular muscles that control eye movements. The front visible part of the eye is made up of the whitish sclera, a coloured iris, and the pupil. A thin layer called the conjunctiva sits on top of this. The front part is also called the anterior segment of the eye.</p>
        <p>The eye is not shaped like a perfect sphere, rather it is a fused two-piece unit, composed of an anterior (front) segment and the posterior (back) segment. The cornea is typically about 11.5 mm (0.3 in) in diameter, and 0.5 mm (500 Î¼m) in thickness near its center. The posterior chamber constitutes the remaining five-sixths; its diameter is typically about 24 mm. The cornea and sclera are connected by an area termed the limbus.</p>

        <h2>Electrical network</h2>
        <img src="Electrical network.jpg" alt="">
        <p>An electrical network is an interconnection of electrical components  or a model of such an interconnection, consisting of electrical elements. An electrical circuit is a network consisting of a closed loop, giving a return path for the current. Linear electrical networks, a special type consisting only of sources , linear lumped elements , and linear distributed elements , have the property that signals are linearly superimposable. </p>
        <p>A resistive circuit is a circuit containing only resistors and ideal current and voltage sources. Analysis of resistive circuits is less complicated than analysis of circuits containing capacitors and inductors. If the sources are constant (DC) sources, the result is a DC circuit. The effective resistance and current distribution properties of arbitrary resistor networks can be modeled in terms of their graph measures and geometrical properties.</p>
