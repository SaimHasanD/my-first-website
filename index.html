        <h2> Flag </h2>
        <img src="Flag.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The national flag of Bangladesh  was adopted officially on 17 January 1972. It consists of a red disc on top  of a green field. The red disc is offset slightly toward the hoist so that it appears centred when the flag is flying. The disc represents the sun rising over Bengal, and also the blood of those who died for the independence of Bangladesh. The green field stands for the lushness of the land of Bangladesh and the eternal youth of Bangladeshis.</p>
